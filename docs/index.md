    <p class="bio-text">I am currently pursuing my PhD at the Oden Institute, University of Texas at Austin. I obtained my BA in Applied Mathematics and Neuroscience in 2022 from Claremont McKenna College with a specialization in computational models of neural processes under John Milton. There I helped design and TA a new computational neuroscience course focusing on leveraging AI in novel analysis of physiological signals. During this time, I also briefly researched the theoeretical side of governing systems through Epistemic Logic.
    
    Before starting my PhD I worked as a bioinfromatics analyst with a drug development company and a small neuroinformatics startup.</p>
